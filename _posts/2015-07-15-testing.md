Oh, hi.

Some personal notes on plugins:
{% raw %}
    {% quote author:"Bob McAwesome" url:http://example.com title:"Great Wisdom" %}
    Never pet a burning dog.
    {% endquote %}

    {% gistnocache 13411532 some_other_gist_file_name.rb %}

    {% codeblock lang:ruby title:"Check if a number is prime" mark:3 %}
    class Fixnum
      def prime?
        ('1' * self) !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
      end
    end
    {% endcodeblock %}

    {% pullquote %}
    When writing long-form posts, I find it helpful to include pull-quotes, which help
    those scanning a post discern whether or not a post is helpful. It is important to
    note, {" pull-quotes are merely visual in presentation and should not appear twice in the text. "} That
    is why it is preferred to use a CSS only technique for styling pull-quotes.
    {% endpullquote %}

    {% video {{ site.cdn }}/videos/clouds.mp4 %}
    {% video featured wide /images/clouds.jpg /videos/clouds.mp4 /videos/clouds.webm /videos/clouds.ogv 1080px 608px preload:auto %}

    {% img /images/ninja.png "Ninja Attack!" %}
    {% img left half http://site.com/images/ninja.png title:"Hidden Ninja" %}
    {% img {{ site.cdn }}/images/ninja.png 150px 150px %}

    {% abort unless site.posts.size > 0 %}

    An example configuration file might look like the following:

    output_style: compact
    sass_options:
    unix_newlines: true
    In order to use other plugins for compass, add them to the require key in your compass.yml file. There is also a load and discover key which map to the relevant commands in Compass' regular configuration file.

    require:
    - zurb-foundation
    There is also a import_paths key which is analogous to the add_import_path line in config.rb.

    import_paths:
    - assets/foundation/scss

{% endraw %}
