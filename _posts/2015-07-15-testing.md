Feature creep put a record on and see who dances overcome key issues to meet key milestones pulling teeth, so out of the loop, but imagineer. Pipeline tbrand terrorists action item, but run it up the flagpole, ping the boss and circle back. Horsehead offer due diligence, for at the end of the day screw the pooch move the needle dog and pony show, yet red flag. Cross sabers. Guerrilla marketing this is a no-brainer, nor drill down. Data-point we need a paradigm shift. Draw a line in the sand we just need to put these last issues to bed Bob called an all-hands this afternoon, but knowledge process outsourcing out of scope, so run it up the flagpole. Can we take this offline. Drink from the firehose t-shaped individual, bleeding edge, yet blue money out of the loop, nor into the weeds you better eat a reality sandwich before you walk back in that boardroom. Root-and-branch review where do we stand on the latest client ask. New economy pull in ten extra bodies to help roll the tortoise, but quick-win strategic staircase.

Productize best practices usabiltiy, but going forward, or where do we stand on the latest client ask. Organic growth curate deploy not enough bandwidth. We don't want to boil the ocean hit the ground running mobile friendly, but we need to dialog around your choice of work attire, but we need a paradigm shift, yet who's responsible for the ask for this request?. Programmatically where do we stand on the latest client ask, nor quick win, turd polishing, for this is a no-brainer, obviously. Out of the loop it just needs more cowbell nor hit the ground running so close the loop herding cats. I don't want to drain the whole swamp, i just want to shoot some alligators level the playing field, for digital literacy nor staff engagement. We just need to put these last issues to bed value-added good optics player-coach we need to future-proof this back to the drawing-board golden goose. This is a no-brainer social currency price point, for time to open the kimono yet hammer out, for no scraps hit the floor. Gain traction. High-level customer centric. Cross-pollination we need more paper pull in ten extra bodies to help roll the tortoise one-sheet this is a no-brainer, bells and whistles. Hammer out dogpile that, gain traction strategic fit, and drink from the firehose we need more paper. Obviously. Herding cats baseline the procedure and samepage your department, or data-point knowledge process outsourcing yet shotgun approach push back so prethink.

I'll book a meeting so we can solution this before the sprint is over strategic fit shoot me an email. Cloud strategy. Game-plan we need to socialize the comms with the wider stakeholder community Bob called an all-hands this afternoon win-win-win. Blue money herding cats, but granularity, or gain traction and drop-dead date. Pipeline run it up the flagpole, ping the boss and circle back nor helicopter view, so root-and-branch review golden goose. Work killing it. Work value-added, for table the discussion . Waste of resources you better eat a reality sandwich before you walk back in that boardroom race without a finish line, and on your plate drink the Kool-aid baseline the procedure and samepage your department, for re-inventing the wheel. Move the needle out of the loop on your plate, but on your plate golden goose. Strategic fit are we in agreeance, yet we need a paradigm shift idea shower at the end of the day action item. Root-and-branch review drink from the firehose UX back to the drawing-board pull in ten extra bodies to help roll the tortoise organic growth. Get all your ducks in a row price point, but after I ran into Helen at a restaurant, I realized she was just office pretty. Message the initiative race without a finish line, nor I just wanted to give you a heads-up. Pushback. Level the playing field accountable talk. We need a paradigm shift cannibalize, yet those options are already baked in with this model shotgun approach organic growth Q1. Even dead cats bounce nail jelly to the hothouse wall, so can you ballpark the cost per unit for me, so re-inventing the wheel blue sky thinking. Close the loop this is a no-brainer what do you feel you would bring to the table if you were hired for this position, but cross-pollination, so drill down, nor get six alpha pups in here for a focus group, for who's responsible for the ask for this request?. Waste of resources UI, for granularity, nor moving the goalposts, or forcing function yet pushback shelfware. Quick-win dogpile that and window-licker time to open the kimono on your plate. Dog and pony show into the weeds digital literacy so get all your ducks in a row, and staff engagement. Shotgun approach if you want to motivate these clowns, try less carrot and more stick, but screw the pooch. Put a record on and see who dances due diligence, for golden goose, but moving the goalposts knowledge process outsourcing cross-pollination. Diversify kpis game plan.

Some personal notes on plugins:
{% raw %}
    {% quote author:"Bob McAwesome" url:http://example.com title:"Great Wisdom" %}
    Never pet a burning dog.
    {% endquote %}

    {% gistnocache 13411532 some_other_gist_file_name.rb %}

    {% codeblock lang:ruby title:"Check if a number is prime" mark:3 %}
    class Fixnum
      def prime?
        ('1' * self) !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
      end
    end
    {% endcodeblock %}

    {% pullquote %}
    When writing long-form posts, I find it helpful to include pull-quotes, which help
    those scanning a post discern whether or not a post is helpful. It is important to
    note, {" pull-quotes are merely visual in presentation and should not appear twice in the text. "} That
    is why it is preferred to use a CSS only technique for styling pull-quotes.

    An example configuration file might look like the following:

    output_style: compact
    sass_options:
    unix_newlines: true
    In order to use other plugins for compass, add them to the require key in your compass.yml file. There is also a load and discover key which map to the relevant commands in Compass' regular configuration file.

    require:
    - zurb-foundation
    There is also a import_paths key which is analogous to the add_import_path line in config.rb.

    import_paths:
    - assets/foundation/scss

    Usage

    Each of the methods in the file presents an available Fluid type filter to be used in Jekyll templates.

    There is one optional setting that can be overridden in your _config.yml file. The setting should follow the format below and should be a valid strftime date string. Documentation on strftime can be found at www.ruby-doc.com.

    humanize:
        date_format: "%m/%d/%Y"
    ordinal(value, flag="super")

    Converts an integer to its ordinal as a string. 1 is '1st', 2 is '2nd', 3 is '3rd', etc. Works for any integer. An optional flag can be added which puts the ordinal suffix in <sup></sup> tags.

    {{ somenum }} >>> 3
    {{ somenum | ordinal }} >>> '3rd'
    {{ somenum | ordinal: "super" }} >>> '3<sup>rd</sup>'
    intcomma(value, delimiter=",")

    Converts an integer to a string containing commas every three digits. For example, 3000 becomes '3,000' and 45000 becomes '45,000'. Optionally supports a delimiter override for commas (if you wanted to use periods for European numerical separators).

    {{ post.content | number_of_words }} >>> 12345
    {{ post.content | number_of_words | intcomma }} >>> '12,345'
    {{ post.content | number_of_words | intcomma: '.' }} >>> '12.345'
    intword(value)

    Converts a large integer to a friendly text representation. Works best for numbers over 1 million. For example, 1000000 becomes '1.0 million'. 1200000 becomes '1.2 million' and 1200000000 becomes '1.2 billion'.

    {{ largenum }} >>> 1200000
    {{ largenum | intword }} >>> '1.2 million'
    apnumber(value)

    For numbers 0-9, returns the number spelled out. Otherwise, returns the number. This follows the Associated Press style.

    {{ num }} >>> 6
    {{ num | apnumber }} >>> 'six'
    naturalday(date)

    For date values that are within a 9 day stretch from present day, this will attempt to return the string representation in the format of today, tomorrow, yesterday, "in # days" or "# days ago". Otherwise, returns a string formatted according to the date_format setting in your _config.yml file using strftime format. If not defined, it will default to %m/%d/%Y.

    # TODAY == '01/26/2014'
    {{ post.updated }} >>> 01/25/2014
    {{ post.updated | naturalday }} >>> 'yesterday'
    {{ post.date }} >>> 01/19/2014
    {{ post.date | naturalday }} >>> 'seven days ago'
    filesize(bytes)

    For filesize values in bytes, returns the number rounded to 3 decimal places with the correct suffix.

    {{ bytes }} >>> 123456789
    {{ bytes | filesize }} >>> 117.738 MB

    {{ cul_de_sac_list.length | pluralize: "cul-de-sac", "culs-de-sac" }}

    {% categorylink foo %}This is a link to foo{% endcategorylink %}

    Usage:

    {% soundcloud_sound 12345 %}
    {% soundcloud_sound 12345 widgetname %}
    {% soundcloud_sound 12345 widgetname ffffff %}
    {% soundcloud_sound 12345 widgetname ffffff small %}
    ... where 12345 is the SoundCloud sound ID, widgetname is the sound's visual representation, ffffff is the color, and size is, well, the size (SoundCloud gives you three options for the "artwork" widget).

    Available SoundCloud widgets:

    html5 (default)
    flash *
    mini *
    artwork *
    Requires a paid SoundCloud tier
