{"title":"Welcome to Jekyll!","tags":" testcat subcat","loc":"/articles/testpost/","text":"You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.\n\nTo add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.\n\nJekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:\n\n{% highlight ruby %}\ndef print_hi(name)\n  puts \"Hi, #{name}\"\nend\nprint_hi('Tom')\n#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nCheck out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].\n\n[jekyll]:      http://jekyllrb.com\n[jekyll-gh]:   https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll\n[jekyll-help]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help\n"}
