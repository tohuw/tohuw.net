> We're stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.
> (Douglas Adams)

I hate coffee in cheap foam cups. The unsettling way it seeps through the pores (longing to escape its possibly carcinogenic confines) is a visceral reminder of the taste: stale, plastic, and hot without warmth. Don't mistake this diatribe for elitism; I'm not too proud to down a Folger's. I have a taste for a well-made Sumatran pour-over, but not a requirement for one. I recognize the reality and utility of a fast cup of coffee to get the job done: put warmth in the bones and caffeine in the bloodstream. I don't need cream, sugar, *et al*; I don't believe in depriving oneself of savor, even if it is the less pleasant bitterness of a cheap coffee, it is still a thing to be experienced. Just, don't put it in those horrid foam cups, okay?

Now that we're through that, I trust we have a better understanding.

My job has nothing to do with coffee, but if you're in my line of work and don't have strong opinions about things like coffee, you can't think correctly. I'm a Systems Engineer, which means I wrangle blinking rectangles[^dasblinkenlights], and try to design and build some nice homes for them to live in.

Specifically, I work with information technology systems, which historically meant "computers doing stuff". This hasn't changed; there's still computers, and they still do stuff, but nowadays we tend to think more about the *stuff* and less about the computers, primarily because of all the thrilling and maddening ways that have come about to make more stuff happen across more (and less) computers in different ways. Functioning software is the apparent outcome of what I do. It's also the most important part, because that's what people care about: they want to use software to make their jobs and lives better.

Unfortunately, there's a fairly sizable obstacle standing in the way of functioning software. It is a knotted mass of strings, wound and tied haphazardly around each other. These strings are problems, like:

-   Computers and other hardware stuff break in some way.
-   Software sometimes has bugs in it, so it doesn't do what it should.
-   Software sometimes has features in it, so it does things not everyone wants it to do[^notabug].
-   There's software that supports the software customers want, and that software has the same problems as above.
-   People don't press the right buttons, causing some combination of the above to be presented as a now-critical issue.[^didtheybreakit]
-   For the stuff to work in the first place, it must have been done with hardware and software that agrees with each other, which is in turn its own ball of string.

My job is to take the outlines of architecture and turn it into a real, viable plan. Then, I help transform that plan into software behaving correctly. Mainly, this is virtualization software, so "behaving correctly" usually means it's serving as a good foundation for other software, like operating systems, containers, and platforms. Virtualization is the seedy underbelly of the modern datacenter, where computer hardware is enslaved to work in unwitting concert with other hardware, forming a cooperative that in turn runs software that doesn't care much whether it runs on one piece of hardware or many (usually).

I like to think about the technical and the philosophical aspects of today's information technology field. I even more like hearing and sharing similar thoughts with others. I find we IT humans are a philosophical, overall humorous lot. I think the humor stems from reconciling the infuriating duality of what seems a rigorous, scientific process sort of job with a frank realization that there's a definitely unscientific art to managing, designing, or developing these things. This happens because people are involved, and though we're often reluctant to admit it, this is what makes the work actually interesting to do.

I aim to write simply and with as little obfuscation as possible, because the goal is to appeal to a wide range of technical backgrounds and skill levels. The best leaps forward in my career have been catalyzed by someone with a great deal more knowledge than me bringing me into a conversation. Ideally, I hope to spark discussions (or outrage) among enough people that I end up somewhere in the middle, with the revered technical gurus to catalyze me further, and those earlier in their journey to encourage. Failing that, at least I'll have recorded some hopefully relevant stuff.

I'll write about these sort of things, and also some non-introspective technical stuff I'd like to share, because too much navel-gazing is bad for the neck. Enjoy.

[^dasblinkenlights]: I'd be remiss to not recall here "[DAS BLINKENLIGHTS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights)", which sums up the regretful kind of humor from which my profession stems.

[^notabug]: A common joke among developers is that some problem with their software is "not a bug, it's a feature". This doesn't matter; disliked features are relative bugs.

[^didtheybreakit]: Whether this is a correct perception in any way varies by situation, and is left as an exercise for the observer.
